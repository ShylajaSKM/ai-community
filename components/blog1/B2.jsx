        AI Product Thinking revolves around identifying problems
first, not solutions. Instead of forcing AI into a business
model, it starts with understanding the user pain points,
data availability, and the outcomes that truly matter.
A strong AI product manager looks beyond “what’s
possible with AI” and focuses on “what’s valuable with AI.”
This mindset encourages critical evaluation—asking
whether automation, prediction, personalization, or
recommendation truly adds business value.

For instance, consider a healthcare startup. Instead of
jumping to build a chatbot just because others are doing it,
AI Product Thinking asks: Can this chatbot reduce patient
wait times? Can it assist doctors with real-time data? This
clarity ensures that AI becomes an enabler, not an
experiment.
