        Traditional product management often focuses on
outputs—features built, releases shipped, or tasks
completed. But in AI Product Thinking, success is
measured by outcomes—improvements in accuracy,
reduced processing time, or enhanced customer
satisfaction.
A model that achieves 95% accuracy on paper means
nothing if it doesn’t improve user experience or business
results in reality. Hence, defining clear KPIs and
measurable outcomes is central to AI-driven product
success.
