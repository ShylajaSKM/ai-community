        Once the problem is validated and objectives are clear, it’s
time to build the AI MVP (Minimum Viable Product). The
MVP stage helps test assumptions quickly without
over-investing resources. The idea is to deploy a lean

version that delivers core functionality—collecting real-world
feedback to improve model accuracy and user adoption.
This iterative approach enables faster learning cycles,
helping teams refine both product strategy and AI
performance with real-world data.
