        To bring AI ideas to life systematically, a few proven
frameworks help streamline the process:<br></br>
● AI Canvas: Helps map the problem statement, data
sources, decision logic, and success metrics.
<br></br>
● CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data
Mining): A structured approach that moves from
<br></br>
business understanding to model deployment and
evaluation.
<br></br>
● Design Thinking + AI: Combines human empathy with
data intelligence—ensuring that products are not only
smart but also meaningful to users.
<br></br>
Using these frameworks ensures teams stay aligned—data
scientists, designers, and business stakeholders all move
toward one shared vision.
