        Introduction: The Shift from AI Hype to AI Impact
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        In today’s innovation-driven world, building successful AI products requires
        more than just technical brilliance—it demands strategic thinking. Many
        organizations rush to adopt AI because it’s trending, but very few step back
        and ask the most important question: What real problem are we solving?
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        This is where AI Product Thinking becomes the differentiator. It’s not about
        creating models; it’s about designing meaningful solutions that align with
        business goals and user needs. It bridges the gap between innovation and
        impact, transforming raw ideas into intelligent solutions that deliver
        measurable value.
