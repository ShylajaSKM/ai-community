        One of the biggest challenges in AI product development is
the communication gap between business teams and
technical teams. AI Product Thinking acts as a bridge—it
ensures that technical decisions (like model choice or data
architecture) are guided by business priorities (like
customer retention or operational efficiency).
It turns complex algorithms into business advantages. The
focus shifts from “How does this model work?” to “How
does this model add value?”
