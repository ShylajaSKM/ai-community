      "3. Action Layer (Autonomy) – The agent executes decisions, such as sending emails, updating systems, or recommending actions, and can call external APIs or tools autonomously.",
      "4. Feedback and Learning Loop – The system learns continuously from feedback and performance data to refine its accuracy and decisions."
